//! Direct Memory Access
//!
//! This module implements Memory To Memory, Peripheral To Memory and Memory to
//! Peripheral transfers. Double buffering is supported only for Peripheral To
//! Memory and Memory to Peripheral transfers.
//!
//!
//! ## Controllers
//!
//! STM32H7 parts contain several DMA controllers with differing
//! capabilities. The choice of DMA controller is a trade-off between
//! capabilities, performance and power usage. This module implements methods
//! for all the available DMA controllers.
//!
//! Whilst not strictly enforced, each peripheral is typically associated with a
//! particular controller. These links are documented in the 'Block
//! interconnect' section of the Reference Manual. In most cases, a peripheral
//! will be used with its associated DMA controller.
//!
//! The following table summarizes the available DMA controllers
//!
//! | Controller | Accessible Memories | Peripheral [TargetAddress](traits::TargetAddress) Implementations | Double Buffering Supported ? | Number of DMA Streams | Initialization Method
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
//! | [MDMA](mdma) | All | `QUADSPI`, .. | No |16| [Transfer::init_master](Transfer#method.init_master)
//! | [DMA1](dma) | AXISRAM, SRAM1/2/3/4 | all others [^notimpl] | Yes |8| [Transfer::init](Transfer#method.init)
//! | [DMA2](dma) | AXISRAM, SRAM1/2/3/4 | all others [^notimpl] | Yes |8| [Transfer::init](Transfer#method.init)
//! | [BDMA](bdma) | SRAM4 [^rm0455bdma] | `LPUART1`, `SPI6`, `I2C4`, `SAI4` | Yes |8| [Transfer::init](Transfer#method.init)
//!
//! [^notimpl]: [TargetAddress](traits::TargetAddress) is not yet implemented
//! for many peripherals
//!
//! [^rm0455bdma]: On 7B3/7A3/7B0 parts there are two BDMA controllers. BDMA1
//! can access SRAM1/2 whilst BDMA2 is limited to SRAM4. For these parts this
//! HAL only supports BDMA2.
//!
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! [Transfer::init](Transfer#method.init) is only implemented for
//! valid combinations of peripheral-stream-channel-direction, providing compile
//! time checking.
//!
//! The module uses [fences](core::sync::atomic::fence) to prevent the compiler
//! and CPU from reording certain operations. This is particularly important
//! since the Cortex-M7 core is otherwise capable of reordering accesses between
//! normal and device memory. See ARM DAI 0321A, Section 3.2 which discusses the
//! use of DMB instructions in DMA controller configuration.
//!
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Starting a transfer
//!
//! Transfer are started using the [`start`](Transfer#method.start) method. This
//! method accepts a closure with a mutable reference to the peripheral for this
//! transfer. For Peripheral to Memory or Memory to Peripheral transfers to/from
//! some peripherals, this closure is used to complete the initialisation of the
//! peripheral. If the Peripheral requires initialisation before enabling the
//! DMA stream, you should do this before creating the transfer or start the
//! transfer using one of the methods available to [continue
//! transfers](#continuing-a-transfer).
//!
//! **Calling start() multiple times on the same transfer is undefined
//! behaviour**. Instead, the transfer should be
//! [continued](#continuing-a-transfer).
//!
//! ### Continuing a transfer
//!
//! For DMA controllers that support Double Buffering, the following methods are
//! available to continue transfers:
//!
//! * [next_transfer](Transfer#method.next_transfer)
//! * [next_transfer_with](Transfer#method.next_transfer_with)
//! * [next_dbm_transfer_with](Transfer#method.next_dbm_transfer_with)
//!
